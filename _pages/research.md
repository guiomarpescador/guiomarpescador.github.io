## Adjusting Model Size in Continual Gaussian Processes: How big is big enough?

TL;DR: We propose a method to adjust the model size of a Gaussian Process in a continual learning setting.

Figure: Three continual learning scenarios with different capacity requirements. Top: 1) a growing input space 2) i.i.d. samples from a uniform distributions, and 3) narrow-range samples with occasional outliers. Bottom: Number of inducing points selected using the VIPS algorithm at each batch. We observed: 1) a linear increase, 2) after initial training, we see a halt in growth, and 3) low model size until it encounters outliers.
