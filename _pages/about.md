Hola ! I am a final year PhD candidate in [Statistics and Machine Learning](https://statml.io) at Imperial College London and the University of Oxford, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Sarah Filippi](https://sarahfilippi.github.io/) and [Mark van der Wilk](https://mvdw.uk/). 

Before starting my PhD, I completed a MMath Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh (2017-2022).

<!-- My research focuses on developing adaptive Bayesian methods that enable probabilistic models to learn efficiently and continuously from evolving data. I am particularly interested in how model capacity can be adjusted dynamically during training, allowing models to balance complexity and generalisation as new information arrives. More broadly, I view learning as a continual process, much like human learning, where experience refines understanding over time. This perspective motivates my work on scalable variational inference and optimisation methods that make continual and non-stationary learning feasible in real-world settings. -->
