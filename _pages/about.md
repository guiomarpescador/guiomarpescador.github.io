I am a PhD student in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning at Imperial College London. 

I am part of the fourth cohort of the StatML CDT between the University of Oxford and Imperial College London. Previously, I studied Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh where I was awarded a Master in Mathematics with Honours.
